FFG Party Boost is a module for Foundry VTT FFG Star Wars system. It allows for the managing and passing of boosts and other dice/symbols to the next actor or specific actors. This includes the ability to pass an upgrade.

A "bonus" bar shows the token image (or, if missing, the main image) and the assigned bonuses.

If a PC rolls, all the bonuses passed to them plus any general bonuses for their side (aka "the player that rolls") will have those values assigned to the dice roller dialog. Clicking "Roll" removes all assigned bonuses. The same applies for NPCs.

Bonuses are tracked per scene. Clicking the "+" allows for actors to be added to the bonus bar from the token on the canvas or actors in the sidebar. The _eye_ icon will hide that actor from the player view.

Clicking on the actor image will show a dialog with available bonuses. GMs may increase a decrease a bonus amount. Players may only add bonuses, not remove them. If a bonus is currently 1, the player need enter the number to be increased by.

Under _Configure Settings_ you can configure whether the players can see NPC and their bonuses as well what bonuses will be available in the "Edit Bonus Resources" dialog. Symbols and Dice can also be hidden from only the Players.
