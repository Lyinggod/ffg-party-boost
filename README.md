FFG Party Boost is a module for Foundry VTT FFG Star Wars system, allowing GMS to track BOOSTS (and other symbols) and automatically apply them to the next actor who roles as skill check based on actor type. This includes that ability to pass on an upgrade to the next skill check or upgrade to difficulty of the next roll.

A "bonus" bar shows the token image (or, if missing, the main image) and the assigned bonuses.

If a PC rolls, all the bonuses passed to them plus any general bonuses for their side (aka "the player that rolls") will have those values assigned to the dice roller dialog. Clicking "Roll" removes all assigned bonuses. The same applies for NPCs.

Clicking the "+" allows for actors to be added to the bonus from the actors in the sidebar. The _eye_ icon will hide that actor from the player view.

Clicking on the actor image will show a dialog to assign bonuses.

Under _Configure Settings_ you can configure whether the players can see NPC and their bonuses as well what bonuses will be available in the "Edit Bonus Resources" dialog.
